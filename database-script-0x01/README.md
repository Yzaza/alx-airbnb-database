# Airbnb Database Schema

This SQL file defines the schema for the Airbnb-like platform, including tables for

- User
- Property
- Booking
- Payment
- Review
- Message

How to run

1. Open your SQL database (PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.)
2. Run the schema file

```bash
psql -U username -d airbnb_db -f schema.sql


3. Tables will be created with primary keys, foreign keys, constraints, and indexes.

---

Once this is done, youâ€™re ready for **Task 3: Seed the Database with Sample Data**, which we can do next.  

Do you want me to prepare the **full seed.sql** for Task 3?
